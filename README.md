## Installation

1.Create a python 3 environment. All the dependencies of a project should be ported in a Venv
    
    virtualenv -p python3 envname

2.Switch to that environment 
    
    source path-to-env/envname/bin/activate
    
    PS - Install virtualenvwrapper to make the virtual env process easier
    
3.Install requirements from `requirements.txt`. 

Use the requirement files for each environment to install all the requirements in a single step using `pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`

4.Edit config file as per your database.
    
    cd inside the config folder
    cd config
    vim local_config.py
 
5.Install RabbitMQ Server

    sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
    
    
6.Run flask migrations 


NOTE - DB `token_problem` should be created manually in postgres


Initialise the db `flask db init`, this would setup a migration directory structure.
It is not required it if already exists in the project.

To create a migration use `flask db migrate` this will pick up the model changes from models.py and create a db script for postgres

To apply already created migrations to the db using `flask db upgrade`. This will push the changes to the DB. This should be the only command needed in production.  
  
6.Run the rabbitmq-server using 

    service rabbitmq-server start
    
7.Run flask server

    python run.py
    
8.Run celery server using 
    
    celery -A app.tasks.tasks worker -Q check_five_min,check_one_min -l info -n token_problem
    
  this will create a default queue and register all the tasks in `app.tasks.tasks`
  in that queue. To test if celery and Rabbitmq and configured correctly, 
  open up a python shell and run the function `add` using
  `add.delay(1,2)`. You should be able to see an output in your celery server logs.
